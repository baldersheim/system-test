Power came from a 5.7-litre, 48-valve version of the legendary Lamborghini V12 featuring dual overhead cams and computer-controlled multi-point fuel injection, producing a maximum output of 492 hp (367 kW) and 427 ft·lbf (579 N·m) of torque. The vehicle could reach 60 mph in slightly over 4 seconds, with a top speed of 202 mph (325 km/h). The Diablo was originally rear-wheel drive and the engine was mid-mounted to aid its weight balance.\n\nEven at over $200,000, the vehicle was somewhat spartan, featuring only basic radio functions (with optional CD playback) along with manual windows, adjustable but unpowered seats and no antilock brakes, mostly to minimize the vehicle's already high curb weight. A few options were available, including having the driver's seat molded specifically for the buyer, a rear wing spoiler, a factory fitted luggage set (priced at $2,600) and an exclusive Breguet clock for the dash (priced at $10,500).\n    ","model":"Diablo","shops_src":["God's Speed Cars","Cars R Us","Cheesy's Used Car Shop"],"popularity":10,"manufacturer":"Lambourghini","orders_per_state":{"TX":0,"IL":0}}},
  {"id":"id:hotcars:hotcars::1","fields":{"description":"The F40 was in the most literal sense designed as the successor to the company's GTO supercar, but the project's meaning ran deeper. At ninety years old, Enzo Ferrari was keenly aware that his life was coming to an end, and was somewhat disappointed that Ferrari's dominance in international motorsport had faded somewhat over the years. As a result, Enzo wanted a new pet project put into the pipelines, something that could remind the world of the company's capabilities as a manufacturer as well as provide both a competitor to the Porsche 959 and come to be his masterpiece; the company's impending 40th anniversary provided just the right occasion for the car to debut. The plan was simple: create a vehicle that combined the company's best technologies into a no-frills sports car that would come as close as possible to being a full fledged race vehicle while still retaining the necessary equipment to be a street-legal product. It was the last car to be commissioned by Enzo himself before his death.\n    ","model":"F40","shops_src":["God's Speed Cars","Purely Red"],"popularity":20,"manufacturer":"Ferrari","orders_per_state":{"TX":0,"IL":0}}},

Known for its impressive size, it is among the world's most recognizable aircraft. First flown commercially in 1970, it held the passenger capacity record for 35 years and was the first commercial wide-body aircraft.\n\nThe four-engine 747, produced by Boeing's Commercial Airplane unit, uses a double decker configuration for part of its length. A typical three-class layout accommodates 416 passengers, while a two-class layout accommodates a maximum of 524 passengers. The hump created by the upper deck has made the 747 a highly recognizable icon of air travel.\n\nThe 747 was expected to become obsolete after sales of 400 units, but it outlived many of its critics' expectations and production passed the 1,000 mark in 1993. As of the end of 2006, 1380 planes had been built with 120 more in various configurations on order. The latest incarnation of the aircraft will be the 747-8.\n    "}}

Korea is lucky to have several employees who are not just dedicated to Yahoo!, but to the betterment of their communities. Some write letters to underprivileged children and others help their neighbors with chores and domestic responsibilities. Recently, two such employees became known to the rest of the world for their good deeds. Yu-ri Choi and Compassion Korea Yu-ri Choi, a project manager on the Yahoo! Custom Brand Experience (CBE) team, has been involved in helping children in need of care and love in the Philippines through a global charity organization called Compassion Korea. Recently, the organization selected Yuri as one of their best supporters and filmed her volunteer activities. Yuri shares some of her experiences with Compassion Korea below. Q: Tell us about your volunteer activities. A: Through Compassion Korea, I have been writing letters over the last five years to help and encourage Neil John, an 11-year-old boy living in the Philippines. I have written him letters every month since 2007. His parents work on a farm for a living and Neil does house chores such as fetching and carrying water, cleaning and running errands, instead of parents. I believe that the letters could fill his life with hope. You can see a some pictures of Neil [and footage from when we met] in this short video from Compassion Korea. Q: According to Compassion Korea, you are the one who sent the most letters. How did you manage your time to write letters that often? A: Once I sent him a letter, he gladly wrote me back and since then we kept in touch. It was time demanding, but I made a rule to write a letter to him often as possible. When you start to care for someone, you usually want to know everything about that person. So, quite naturally, we got to share our everyday stories through letters, so writing a letter was not difficult for me. Q: What makes you continue doing this? A: I feel my heart flutter when I write him a letter and the expectation of having an answer from him makes me happy. I had a chance to meet him in person during my visit to the Philippines and I was very moved by the look on his face that he was overwhelmed with joy for meeting me in real life. Kelly Byul Hahm and Yahoo! Angels Yahoo! Angles is a volunteer community group formed at Yahoo! Korea in 2007. What started as a small group has grown to an official club which regularly visits local orphanages. Kelly Byul Hahm, the president of Yahoo! Angels and a member of the Retention, Insight and Research (RIR) team in Korea, talks about the grassroots group. Q: What activities have been undertaken so far? A: Yahoo! Angels provides a regular visit to social welfare centers to spend time together with children in first to sixth grades through a variety of outdoor activities (visits to amusement parks, pools, sledge parks, cinema) and hands-on learning opportunities (science programs). In addition, we ask organizations to share lists of children who have no supporters or those who may not receive holiday presents in order to send them winter clothes and New Year school supplies. Q: Who is participating in Yahoo! Angels? A: Yahoo! Angels is the fourth largest company club [at Yahoo! Korea] with 17 active members. It is larger than the number of its members actually because it is also supported by other company clubs and retirees on a continual basis. Q: What is your most memorable activity? A: I started this activity here in the summer of 2007. Since then, I have never missed paying a visit in five years. During this period, my most memorable moment was when I first visited an orphanage where I met a seven-year-old boy named Jin-young. When I saw him first, he was tough and rebellious and I was even afraid to talk to him. Other children were easy to handle. We usually got closer after we met a couple of times. But it was really difficult to deal with this boy. It took so long. But after about two years, I realized all of a sudden that he opened his mind to me because I saw a beautifully bright and genuine smile on his face. He no longer defied me and got tough to me. He turned obedient and cared about other boys younger than him. I came to understand from his eyes that he had a belief in me that I am a person who is always in his side unlike other volunteers who came to see him occasionally. Though it was a burdensome period for me, I felt really grateful to see that he grew not only physically but also mentally over the past two years. Q: Why is the group so meaningful to you? A: Not long ago, I met with a director of a volunteer organization outside Yahoo!. He told me that altruistic egoism or the things which they do for others will benefit themselves eventually. I would like to say that doing a good deed will make your life more enriching and meaningful.","title":"Angels Across Yahoo!

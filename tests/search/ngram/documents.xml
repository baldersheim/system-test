The first red flag is the presence of an "else" clause in your conditionals.  I am not saying that you should never use "else" in your code, but when you do, you should stop and think about what you are doing, because most of the time you are about to write code that is unnecessarily complex.  Let's consider the following

    public void someMethod() {
      if (condition1) {
        if (condition2) {
          // do something
        } else {
          // do something when condition1 is 
          // true and condition2 is false
        }
      } else {
        // do something when condition1 is
        // false
      }
    }

I am not saying that you should never use \"else\" in your code, but when you do, you should stop and think about what you are doing, because most of the time you are about to write code that is unnecessarily complex.  Let's consider the following\n\n    public void someMethod() {\n      if (condition1) {\n        if (condition2) {\n          // do something\n        } else {\n          // do something when condition1 is \n          // true and condition2 is false\n        }\n      } else {\n        // do something when condition1 is\n        // false\n      }\n    }\n\n\nNow, the above code is not an uncommon sight. Unfortunately, it is not very readable code. You often see this sort of code when people do things like trying to acquire some resources, like opening files.
